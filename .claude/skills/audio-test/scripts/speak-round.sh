# One 同声传译 round on the Mac dev build, scored. The ESP32 says "my" three sentences near the mic
# while the talk key is held (lsctl talkDown / talkUp), one press each. Usage:
#   speak-round.sh <label> [quiet|meeting|silent] [volume 0-100]
#     quiet    the Mac plays nothing
#     meeting  the Mac plays meeting.wav (English, no breaks) from the speakers through every press
#     silent   meeting.wav plays and the key is held, but nobody says anything
# Env: VP (speakVP on|off: the talk key's mic through echo cancellation, default on as in the app), MIC
# (打开麦克风 on|off during the round, default off), SPEAKMIC (the talk key's mic, a name part; default the
# MacBook's: with AirPods as the system input the talk key would hear them), OUT, WORK (as room-round.sh).
# Prints per press what was heard and sent, whether the meeting's English got into what I said,
# what reached the room's lines with MIC on, and the time from release to the translation.
